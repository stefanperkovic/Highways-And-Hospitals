| Sep 11 | 5:40 - 6:10 | I started thinking about how to approach the problem set. I decided that it would be nice if we could get rid of the extraneous solution when hospitals are cheaper than highways at the start. However, I realized I couldn't just multiple hospitalCost * cities.length because the cities function is the highway links, so I have left it their for now but will change later. Afterwards I decided that it would be simpler to check if their was a connection between cities if we just had a boolean array that would tells us so I made that. |

It would be best to detect these components and then treat them separately as you can't build highways between them. I decided that DFS would make sense here as you start at one node and go through all its connections that haven't been visited to create a section. Using a stack here makes sense as you go to the closest conenctions first and don't skip connections. |

We discussed how we should divide into subtrees build only 1 hopsital in each and the amount of cities - 1 is how many highways we need to build. We can store this information in a ArrayList and do simple arithemtic in the end to find the total cost. We can do either DFS or BFS and keep track of whats been visited to no double count.  |
