| Sep 11 | 5:40 - 6:10 | I started thinking about how to approach the problem set. I decided that it would be nice if we could get rid of the extraneous solution when hospitals are cheaper than highways at the start. However, I realized I couldn't just multiple hospitalCost * cities.length because the cities function is the highway links, so I have left it their for now but will change later. Afterwards I decided that it would be simpler to check if their was a connection between cities if we just had a boolean array that would tells us so I made that. |

It would be best to detect these components and then treat them separately as you can't build highways between them. I decided that DFS would make sense here as you start at one node and go through all its connections that haven't been visited to create a section. Using a stack here makes sense as you go to the closest conenctions first and don't skip connections.  |
