| Sep 11  | 5:40 - 6:10 | I started thinking about how to approach the problem set. I decided that it would be nice if we could get rid of the extraneous solution when hospitals are cheaper than highways at the start. However, I realized I couldn't just multiple hospitalCost * cities.length because the cities function is the highway links, so I have left it their for now but will change later. Afterwards I decided that it would be simpler to check if their was a connection between cities if we just had a boolean array that would tells us so I made that. |
