| Sep 11 | 5:40 - 6:10 | I started thinking about how to approach the problem set. I decided that it would be nice if we could get rid of the extraneous solution when hospitals are cheaper than highways at the start. However, I realized I couldn't just multiple hospitalCost * cities.length because the cities function is the highway links, so I have left it their for now but will change later. Afterwards I decided that it would be simpler to check if their was a connection between cities if we just had a boolean array that would tells us so I made that. |

It would be best to detect these components and then treat them separately as you can't build highways between them. I decided that DFS would make sense here as you start at one node and go through all its connections that haven't been visited to create a section. Using a stack here makes sense as you go to the closest connections first and don't skip connections. |
| Sep 12 | 8:50 - 9:20 |                                                                                                    I worked with Isha and Kieran on triyng to come up with the opitimal way to solve the problem set. We discussed how we should divide into subtrees build only 1 hopsital in each and the amount of cities - 1 is how many highways we need to build. We can store this information in a ArrayList and do simple arithemtic in the end to find the total cost. We can do either DFS or BFS and keep track of whats been visited to no double count. |

I first fixed the edge case of hospitals being cheaper than highways to just multiply by n the amount of cities. Then I create a roots array to store all the cities roots. I looped through each city making sure not to override any previous roots. I then made the 1st node the root of the second node. |
| Sep 12 | 6:15 - 6:45 |                                 I looked through my array of roots and as we did on the worksheet if an entry was a zero or "blank" I added one. Then I did the equation that we did on the worksheet below. After testing I realized that I wasn't going deeper into the roots as I was supposed to. I would only get the first root not the one after that. I created two while loops to go through and go through the current cities roots to find the last one. Then I made that the city I would make the root of the root of the first number.  |
